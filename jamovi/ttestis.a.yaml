        The Student's Independent samples t-test (sometimes called a two-samples
        t-test) is used to test the null hypothesis that two groups have the
        same mean. A low p-value suggests that the null hypothesis is not true,
        and therefore the group means are different.

        The Student's independent t-test assumes that the data from each group
        are from a normal distribution, and that the variances of these groups
        are equal. If unwilling to assume the groups have equal variances, the
        Welch's t-test can be used in it's place. If one is additionally
        unwilling to assume the data from each group are from a normal
        distribution, the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test can be used instead
        (However, note that the Mann-Whitney U test has a slightly different
        null hypothesis; that the distributions of each group is equal).
